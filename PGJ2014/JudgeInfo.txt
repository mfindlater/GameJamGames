Story:
-----
Control the spirit incarnate of William "Billy" Penn. His wrath has been summoned by the ever-encroaching presence of modern commercialism, threatening to destroy his legacy.

That and something about a curse on Philly if someone builds above his head.

Your job: DECONSTRUCT PHILLY!


Goal:
----
You are in a race to reap your revenge! Destroy the growing buildings by damaging both sides of a structure. 

During the night buildings slowly grow, but during the day they will grow quickly!

Avoid falling to the streets below as it delays your rampage while you climb back to the top of City Hall. 

If a building passes your hat line you'll lose points and if a building passes the top of the screen all hope is lost!
